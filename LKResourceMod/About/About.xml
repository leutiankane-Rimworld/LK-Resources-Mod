    <description>My First Rimworld Mod.  This one adds my version of ForeRunner Metal from RimFlood into the game.
--This metal will work with nearly anything stuffable, even gravship hulls and armor/clothing.This resource is automatically added to the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2503894706]Mines 2.0[/url] mod building's bills to be "mineable". 
--Also Craftable in the Fabricator after researching advanced fabrication.
--Includes Wall Mounted Sun Lamp now,that has 12 radius and consumes 2 power.
--Includes Power generators of all vanilla types that are 10 to 100x the vanilla power output and cost to make, that are locked behind extra research as well.
--Includes Battery that is 100x power storage and cost as well that is locked behind research.
--Includes Passenger Shuttle from Odyssey that has increased carry and fuel capacity for increased cost.
Yes i realize the metal is a bit OP but its meant to be used in playthru's using High end factions like V.O.I.D , Warhammer , star wars , etc  so bare that in mind when considering "balance".</description>
