# LK-Resources-Mod
My First Rimworld Mod. This one adds my version of ForeRunner Metal from RimFlood into the game.
--This metal will work with nearly anything stuffable, even gravship hulls and armor/clothing.This resource is automatically added to the Mines 2.0 mod building's bills to be "mineable". IF you download LK Mines 2.0 Compatability patch 
--Also Craftable in the Fabricator after researching advanced fabrication.
--Includes Wall Mounted Sun Lamp now,that has 24 radius and consumes 2 power.
--Adds uber Generators and battery as well for increased power output and storage at a cost.
--Added Uber Passenger Shuttle if you have odyssey installed Higher Storage capacity and Fuel capacity at a higher cost to construct.(requires Odyssey)

Moved Airtight support to LK Airtight Patch Mod.


Yes i realize the metal is a bit OP but its meant to be used in playthru's using High end factions like V.O.I.D , Warhammer , star wars , etc so bare that in mind when considering "balance"
